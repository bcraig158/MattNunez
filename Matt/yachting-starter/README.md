# Haven No. 8 — Yachting/Concierge Starter

Multi‑page static starter inspired by the “Yachting” template structure (home, services, yachts, about, quick reservation, contact, FAQ, privacy, terms). No build step required.

## Quick start
- Preview locally: `python -m http.server 8080` → http://localhost:8080
- Deploy: upload the folder to your web server (nginx/Apache).

## Customize
- Colors & typography: edit CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
- Replace images in `/assets` with your own photos.
- Wire forms by changing each `<form action="#">` to your endpoint.
